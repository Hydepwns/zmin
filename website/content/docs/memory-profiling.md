# Memory Profiling

Understanding memory usage patterns is crucial for optimizing performance. This page provides detailed insights into zmin's memory allocation patterns and optimization opportunities.

## Memory Management Strategy

zmin employs several strategies to minimize memory usage:

### 1. Streaming Architecture
- Process data in chunks rather than loading entire files
- Constant memory usage regardless of file size
- Ideal for large JSON files

### 2. Memory Pools
- Pre-allocated memory pools for common allocation sizes
- Reduces allocation overhead
- Minimizes fragmentation

### 3. Zero-Copy Operations
- Direct memory mapping for file I/O
- In-place transformations where possible
- Minimal intermediate buffers

## Optimization Guidelines

### For Small Files (<10MB)
- Use standard mode for simplicity
- Memory usage typically under 5MB
- No special optimizations needed

### For Medium Files (10MB-100MB)
- Consider streaming mode for memory-constrained environments
- Peak memory usage around 10-20MB
- Enable memory profiling to identify hotspots

### For Large Files (>100MB)
- Always use streaming mode
- Enable GPU acceleration if available
- Monitor memory usage with built-in profiling tools

## Memory Profiling Tools

```bash
# Enable memory profiling
zmin --memory-profile input.json

# Generate detailed memory report
zmin --memory-report=detailed input.json > memory.log

# Real-time memory monitoring
zmin --memory-monitor input.json
```

## Common Memory Issues

### High Peak Memory
**Symptom**: Memory spikes during processing
**Solution**: Enable streaming mode or reduce buffer sizes

### Memory Fragmentation
**Symptom**: Gradually increasing memory usage
**Solution**: Use memory pools for frequent allocations

### Memory Leaks
**Symptom**: Memory not released after processing
**Solution**: zmin has zero memory leaks - verify third-party integrations

## Best Practices

1. **Profile First**: Always profile before optimizing
2. **Monitor Trends**: Track memory usage over time
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Include very large and deeply nested JSON
4. **Validate Changes**: Ensure optimizations don't impact correctness
